# SmallGame_Stack_Imitator

This small game is to imitate an important DS - stack, aka FILO. I wrote this app in Python 3 and use pyinstaller to make an installation-free excutable. This is for Windows OS.

Type something in the input field and hit the enter key, then you will push an element into the stack.
